I am creating this repository with the primary goal of organizing and documenting my machine learning projects. 
Here, I will store, write, and modify various machine learning models and applications as part of my ongoing learning journey in the field of artificial intelligence and data science.

The projects included here will showcase my progress and development as I explore different algorithms, datasets, and techniques in machine learning. 
Each project will be accompanied by comprehensive documentation to explain the problem statement, methodology, implementation details, and results obtained.

Through this repository, I aim to not only hone my skills in machine learning but also to contribute to the community by sharing my learnings and insights. I welcome feedback, 
suggestions, and collaborations from fellow enthusiasts and experts in the field.
